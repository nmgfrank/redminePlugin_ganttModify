##redminePlugin_ganttModify

This is a redmine plugin which now only support redmine 2.3.2 to redmine 2.3.3.

To deploy this plugin, you should copy ./gantt_modify into plugins folder of redmine.

If issues are related with fixed version, there will be a disorder of father-child relationship among issues in the original gantt. This Plugin offers a new gantt page, you can jump into it by clicking the botton on the top-right corner.

In the new page, father-child relationship among issues will never be effected by fix version. Three tiny buttons are added. They offer some convinience to view the gantt page.
